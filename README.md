# Mock semaphore using Raspberry Pi Pico

This is my indivitual project which I have presented during the spring semester at BÃ¡bes Bolyai University in the 3rd year of my Bachelor's degree studies.

This small Raspberry Pi Pico project aims to simulate a traffic semaphore. After a set amount of time, the vehicle semaphore will switch between red, yellow and green. The pedestrian semaphore will stay on red until a pedestrian request to cross. When a request is made, the wait led for pedestrians is trigger(yellow), the vehicle semaphore will be set on red and the pedestrian semaphore will be set on green. A buzzer will beep for the whole period when pedestrians are allowed to cross the street

### Setup and Build

Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to a laptop and the circuit will start working.
Press any of the two buttons to trigger a green light for the pedestrians.

### Running

The code is run on two threas:
* the main thread: keeps track of the vehicle semaphore and will comute between red, yellow and green
* the second thread: is triggered by the main thread and will run the semaphore for the pedestrians (meanwhile, the main thread is put to sleep)
